### Instructions for Artists Using the Inventory File

#### 1. Create One Entry Per Artwork

Each artwork should have its own row in the spreadsheet or system.

Example:

| artworkid | title              | year |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---- |
| #ART001   | Untitled Landscape | 2026 |

Avoid placing multiple artworks in one row.

---

#### 2. Use a Consistent Artwork ID System

The **artworkid** field should contain a unique identifier for each work.

Suggested formats:

* `#ART001`
* `#PN2026-05`
* `#TMSPNTULI15`

A consistent coding system helps with:

* locating artworks
* matching certificates
* tracking exhibitions
* managing sales and consignments
* building catalogues raisonnés

---

#### 3. Add Image References

The **imgurl** field can link to:

* uploaded artwork photographs
* cloud storage
* website images
* internal image databases

This makes visual identification easier without searching through folders.

---

#### 4. Record Accurate Dimensions

Measure artworks carefully and enter:

* **Height**
* **Width**
* **Depth**

Use one consistent unit throughout the inventory, such as:

* centimeters (cm)
* millimeters (mm)
* inches (in)

For two-dimensional works, depth may be:

* `0`
* or a small thickness value.

---

#### 5. Document Medium and Materials

The **artwork_medium_id** and **paper_type_id** fields help classify materials and supports.

Examples may include:

* oil on canvas
* charcoal on paper
* photographic print
* collage
* mixed media

Material documentation is useful for:

* conservation
* framing
* insurance
* exhibition preparation
* research and archiving

---

#### 6. Update Inventory Regularly

The inventory should be updated whenever:

* new works are created
* works are sold
* artworks are exhibited
* images are updated
* records are corrected
* artworks move between locations

A current inventory reduces loss of information and supports professional studio administration.

---

#### 7. Maintain Backup Copies

Keep copies of the inventory in multiple locations:

* local computer
* external drive
* cloud storage
* studio server or database

Regular backups protect against accidental data loss.

---

### Purpose of the Inventory

Maintaining an artwork inventory helps artists:

* archive artistic production
* track studio output over time
* prepare exhibitions and loan lists
* support provenance documentation
* manage online shops and collections
* organize research and documentation
* maintain professional records for collectors, galleries, and institutions

A well-maintained inventory becomes both an administrative tool and a long-term archive of artistic practice.
